# Python Basics
The basics to get started

### Print
https://repl.it/@webdevdave/Basic-Python-print#main.py

The most common use
```
print("Cookie Monster")
```

Using the format string method
```
x = 12345
y = 'Kelly'

print('{}, and {}' .format(x, y))
```

Using the f-string, not to be confused with the f-bomb
```
x = 4567
y = 'Cookie monster'
print(f'x is {x} and y is {y}')
```

Old school - %d is for data, %s is for string
```
x = 9594934
y = 'Oingo Boingo'
print('%d and %s', %(x, y))
```
